QuickCheck Mini

This is a fully functional stripped down version of Quviq QuickCheck. 

QuickCheck Mini is free of charge and the latest version can be
downloaded from Quviq's homepage. The Mini version of QuickCheck is
intended to support individuals and open source projects in obtaining
a better code quality without having to invest in the full version of
QuickCheck.

QuickCheck Mini is installed by copying the complete directory
eqc-.... into the Erlang library directory or by pointing to it by
using the code:add_patha/1 function in the Erlang distribution.

Examples are provided to illustrate how it works.

You can subscribe to quickcheck-questions@quviq.com by sending

the use of QuickCheck.

Please note that although QuickCheck Mini does not require a licence
check with the Quviq licence server, it does check for a new version
each time it is started, and will notify you if one is available. No
other information is included in the request, and QuickCheck Mini will
start regardless of whether or not the version check succeeds, but
(because there is a short time-out) will start slightly more quickly
when it succeeds.
